# Installing tidyverse

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
]

# Github

.valign-slide[
* Please sign up for an account on Github (http://github.com) using your Mason email address if you do not have one already

# Obtain Repository

.valign-slide[
* Click the link distributed to you in Slack to get your Lab 1 repository and accept the assignment

* Click "Clone or Download", and make sure it says "Use HTTPS" in bold in the top left of the pop-up box.

* Click the clipboard to copy the link

* In RStudio, go to File → New Project.

* Click Version Control, then Git.

* Paste the link you just copied into the Repository URL box.

* Leave the Project directory name blank.

* Click Browse and create a directory where you store your labs, for example as `CDS102`, and select it.
]

# Obtain Repository

.valign-slide[
* An RStudio project should now open up, which will allow you to start working on your homework assignment.

* You will probably see a blank console screen.

* However, in RStudio you should also see a list of all of the files available.

* Click on the `lab01.Rmd` file and edit away.

* If you save and close R Studio and want to go back to editing your project, open up R Studio, then go to File → Open Project.

* Navigate to the project directory and double click on the .Rproj file.

# .font80[Using symbols to "mark up" your document]

* As you can see, the combination of RMarkdown and RStudio combines text processing with the ability to execute code written in R.

* However, unlike software like Microsoft Word, there aren't any formatting buttons for doing things like creating **bold** or *italicized* text.

* RMarkdown does this using symbols that stand for different types of text markups.

* For example, typing `**bold text**` in RMarkdown signals you want the words `bold text` to be bolded.

* Paragraphs are separated by a blank line, for example:

```md
This is the end of the first paragraph.

This starts the next paragraph.
However, putting a line right below it will not start a new paragraph.
```

# Time to practice!
